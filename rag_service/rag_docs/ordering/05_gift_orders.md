# Gift Orders

## How to Place a Gift Order
You can choose to send an item as a gift if it's a **Fulfilled by Amazon** product. This option is available during the checkout process.

### Steps to Gift-Wrap an Item
1.  Add the item to your shopping cart.
2.  Check the **"This will be a gift"** box next to the item in your cart, or check the **"Ordering a gift?"** option during checkout.
3.  On the "Delivery & Payment" page, you will see the gift options.
4.  Gift-wrapping is available for a fee of **â‚¹30** per item.
5.  You can also include a gift message that will be sent to the recipient.

## Gift Receipts
When you send a gift, you can choose to include a digital gift receipt. This receipt does not show the price but provides the recipient with the necessary information to return the item if needed. The physical product will be delivered with a standard invoice, and price tags are left intact to facilitate returns.

### Edge Cases
- Eligibility: The gift-wrap option is only valid for items that are Fulfilled by Amazon.
- Returns: To learn how a gift recipient can return an item, they should refer to Amazon's "Return a Gift" help page.
