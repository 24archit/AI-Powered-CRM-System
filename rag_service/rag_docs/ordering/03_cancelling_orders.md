# Cancelling Items and Orders

## How to Cancel an Order
You can cancel an order or specific items by visiting the **Your Orders** section of your account.

### Before the Order Is Shipped
1.  Go to **Your Orders**.
2.  Select the item you wish to cancel and click **Cancel items**.
3.  Provide a reason for the cancellation (optional) and confirm by clicking **Cancel Checked Items**.

### After the Order Is Shipped (Out for Delivery)
1.  Go to **Your Orders**.
2.  Select the **Request cancellation** option and proceed.
3.  If the item is already on its way, it will be returned to Amazon for a refund.
4.  **Note:** If the delivery person still contacts you, simply refuse to accept the package.

## Key Cancellation Policies
- Combined Shipments: If your order is combined with other active orders into a single shipment, cancelling one item may result in the cancellation of all other items in that shipment.
- Partial Cancellation: If you partially cancel an order, the refund for the cancelled items will be processed after the remaining items have been fulfilled and shipped.
- Refunds: For cancelled orders, the refund is issued to your original payment method. The refund timeline varies based on the payment method.

## Cancelling Seller-Fulfilled Orders
- Within 30 minutes: You can cancel directly from "Your Orders" within 30 minutes of placing the order.
- After 30 minutes: You must request a cancellation from the seller. If the seller approves, the refund will be processed by them.
- After shipping: Once a seller-fulfilled order is shipped, it cannot be cancelled. You must refuse the delivery to initiate a return and refund.

### Best Practices for Cancellation
- Always check the "Your Orders" section for the most accurate status and available cancellation options.
- For orders that have already shipped, refusing the package is the most reliable way to ensure it's returned and a refund is initiated.
- If you face issues with a seller, remember that Amazon's **A-to-Z Guarantee** can protect you if the seller fails to resolve your issue.
