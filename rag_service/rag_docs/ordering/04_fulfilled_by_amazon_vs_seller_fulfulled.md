## Seller Fulfilled Orders
Items labeled **"Sold and fulfilled by (seller name)"** are managed and shipped directly by a third-party seller.
- **Key Differences:**
    - Customer Service: The seller is responsible for customer service, shipping, and returns. You must contact the seller directly for issues.
    - Shipping Charges: Shipping fees and speeds are determined by the individual seller and can vary.
    - Return Policy: Return and refund terms may vary from seller to seller, but all are covered by the A-to-Z Guarantee.
    - Cancellations: The cancellation window is shorter (often only 30 minutes), and you may need to request cancellation from the seller.
- **How to Identify:** The product page will clearly state **"Sold by (seller name) and Ships from (seller name)."**
