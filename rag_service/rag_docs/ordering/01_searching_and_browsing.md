## Understanding Search Results and Sort Options
Amazon uses a variety of factors to determine the order of search results to help you find what you're looking for quickly.

### Default "Featured" Sort
By default, search results are sorted by "Featured." This ranking is based on factors that include:
- Customer Actions: How frequently an item was searched for, clicked on, added to the cart, or purchased.
- Item Information: Title, price, and description.
- Logistics: Availability, delivery speed, and shipping costs.
- Relevance: Whether the item is new or of likely interest to the customer.

### Other Sort Options
You can change how results are displayed using these sort options:
- Avg. Customer Review: Sorts items based on average star rating and the number of reviews.
- Newest Arrivals: Sorts items based on the date they were first available on Amazon.
- Price Low to High: Arranges items from the lowest to the highest price.
- Price High to Low: Arranges items from the highest to the lowest price.
- Best Sellers: Sorts results based on recent sales history.
